# Spring Representation and Calculations

This repository contains a PDF document. The document demonstrates the mathematical representation and calculations related to springs, including their vector representation, force calculations, and damping effects. It utilizes key principles of physics and mathematics such as Hooke's Law, vector algebra, and Newton's second law. 

## Features

The document includes the following sections:

### 1. **Spring Representation**
- Describes a spring as a line segment between two points with coordinates $p_1(x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2(x_2, y_2)$.
- Defines the initial length of the spring ($L$).

### 2. **Vector Representation**
- Defines the displacement vector ($\mathbf{V}$) between the two endpoints.
- Calculates the magnitude ($M$) and unit vector ($\hat{\mathbf{V}}$) of the displacement vector.

### 3. **Force Calculation (Hooke's Law)**
- Derives the restoring force using Hooke's Law:
  \[ F = -k . x \]
- Calculates the displacement ($x$) as the difference between the current length and the initial length.
- Provides the force in terms of the spring's length and unit vector.

### 4. **Force Vector**
- Computes the force components ($F_x$, $F_y$) along the x and y axes.

### 5. **Damping**
- Introduces damping effects and adjusts the force components to include a damping constant and velocity components.

### 6. **Newton's Second Law and Updates**
- Applies Newton's second law:
  \[ F = m . a ]
- Demonstrates velocity and position updates for both endpoints based on forces and time steps.

## Usage
